# Welcome to Space Hero
This is a simple GBA game, created as a part of CS2110.
## Instructions
In this game, you will pilot a spaceship through a dangerous field of obstacles to try and reach the space station. If you collide with any of the asteroids, your spaceship will explode and the game will end. If you manage to make it to the space station, you will win the game and see your score. The lower your score is, the better your performance on this mission. The score will also be available in the top right corner of the game's screen as you are playing it.
